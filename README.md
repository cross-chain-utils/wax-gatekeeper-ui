# wax-gatekeeper-ui

React components for interacting with a wax-gatekeeper server

# Note for local testing:

You need to alias the react components to be able to use "npm link" for local testing of the module. This should not be the case when you install the module from npm.

```"alias": {
    "react": "../../{YOUR PROJECT}/client/node_modules/react",
    "react-bootstrap": "../../{YOUR PROJECT}/client/node_modules/react-bootstrap",
    "react-dom": "../../{YOUR PROJECT}/client/node_modules/react-dom"
  }
```
